//! Filter effects API based on the W3C Filter Effects specification.
//!
//! This module provides a comprehensive filter system supporting both high-level
//! CSS filter functions and low-level SVG filter primitives. The API is designed
//! to follow the W3C Filter Effects Module Level 1 specification.
//!
//! See: <https://drafts.fxtf.org/filter-effects/>

// ## Vello Implementation Status
//
// ### Implemented
//
// **Filter Functions:**
// - `Blur` - Gaussian blur effect
//
// **Filter Primitives (Single Use Only):**
// - `Flood` - Solid color fill
// - `GaussianBlur` - Gaussian blur filter
// - `DropShadow` - Drop shadow effect (compound primitive)
// - `Offset` - Translation/shift (single primitive)
